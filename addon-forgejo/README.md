# Forgejo addon

Take back control of your software development process, self-host your projects and get everyone involved in delivering quality software on the same page. 

## â€¯About

This addon is based on docker image made by https://forgejo.org/docs/next/admin/installation-docker/#docker
<!-- It provides admin user configuration, no need to launch docker commands to create admin.
I didn't expose all other settings, let's see if it is needed at some point. -->

Happy giting !
